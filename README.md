The <b>Software Engineering Final Exam</b> of the 2021-2022 school year requires the development of a software version (in Java) of the Eriantys board game, a Cranio Creations product that is inspired by and attempts to renew the already established Carolus Magnus.

Eriantys is a game full of strategy, tactics and twists. Plan your moves carefully and try to control the moves of your opponents. With three different game modes, including a team game, Eriantys offers always different and interesting games. Also, if you play with the expert variant, you can use the fantastic abilities of the special characters: each adds many possibilities, enriching the fun and beauty of the challenge.
